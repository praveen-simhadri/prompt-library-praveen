# prompt-library-praveen

A collection of modular, reusable, and safe prompt templates for GPT agents — aimed at business applications and alignment roles.

## Structure

- **prompts/** — contains prompt templates  
- **prompts/guardrails/** — safety / filtering prompt templates  
- **examples/** — sample inputs & outputs to demonstrate usage  

## Prompt Templates

### Resume Tailor  
Rewrite resumes to match job descriptions without inventing new content.

### HR Policy Bot  
Answer employee questions based on policy text only, refusing speculation.

### Jailbreak Filter  
Block unsafe / disallowed prompts by analyzing user inputs.

## How to Use

1. Copy the template you need  
2. Replace placeholders (e.g. `{user_input}`) with real data  
3. Combine with your code (Python, JS, etc.) to feed into GPT  
4. Use the guardrail prompts to filter or evaluate input before sending  

## Why This Portfolio Matters

- Demonstrates your understanding of **modularity** in prompt design  
- Shows awareness of **safety, alignment, and refusal** principles  
- Gives tangible artifacts you can show to recruiters or hiring teams
